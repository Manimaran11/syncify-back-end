# Syncify Backend

_Syncify is a tool to listen to podcasts and audio in ‚Äòsync‚Äô with your friends and enable real conversations around the content you love._

Listening to content is an often lonely pursuit where you just listen to things in your own world, disconnected from your friends. It is hard to talk to friends about things when they listen to something you listened to three months later (or never). Syncify allows users to listen to audio (podcasts, books, and music) in sync and encourage conversation with real people and be less lonely.

Users can listen at the exact same time (live-sync) or catch up on things the other has listened recently (). Syncing awesome üòù

## Covid-19

Due to the covid-19 crisis this app suddenly felt a more urgent priority with it's purpose of reducing feelings of isolation. As such I am making it Open source to get things moving faster and contribute to maintaining the sanity of many people going through hard times.

## Code

This is a NodeJS project with Express, GraphQL, PSQL and Auth0 login

---

### Database

This repo is currently using a local PostgreSQL instance

This is temporarily until docker is set up

You will need to set up a local [PostgreSQL db](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to connect to the db

The application is currently using [bookshelf.js](https://bookshelfjs.org/) and [knex.js](http://knexjs.org/)

---

### GraphQL

Testing GraphQL querys/mutations can be done through [GraphIQL](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)

Testing endpoints with bearer token:
- You can get your bearer token if you console.log(extraParams.id_token) in app.js during the Auth0Strategy set up.
- After that click "edit HTTP Headers" in graphiql.
- Add "Bearer " to the beginning of the jwt string
- Add a new header name:authorization value:*from the step above*

---

### Environment Setup

- DB variables are from the Database section above
