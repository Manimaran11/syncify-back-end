# Syncify Backend

This repo uses Express and GraphQL with Auth0 for login

-----

### Database

Currently we use MongoDB

The repo won't run locally if you don't set up a basic mongodb.
You can do it in your local checkout; the /data directory is ignored by gitignore.

If you've never done this before
brew services stop mongodb
brew uninstall mongodb

brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community
sudo mkdir -p data/db

Then
mongod --dbpath data/db
in a separate window
mongo

then in the mongo interface
use etherpay


-----

### Run the app

`npm install`

`npm start`

It will run on port 3033 unless specified otherwise on env.PORT
